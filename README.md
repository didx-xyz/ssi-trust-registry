# Trust Registry
An implementation of a Trust Registry for Self-Sovereign Identity Ecosystems

## Background
After some initial discussion between ABSA and DIDx regaring development of a Trust Registry that can be used in the South African SSI Ecosystem we determined that both entities developed a version of a Trust Registry but we have a requirement to develop one implementation that can be used by everyone.
